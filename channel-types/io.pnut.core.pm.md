<!-- provide a description for this channel type's behavior -->
This channel type is for private messages between 2 or more people. As a core Channel type, it has some special restrictions designed to simplify adoption for developers. 

Private message channels enforce that there is at least one non-owner user_id in the write ACL and that ACLs are immutable.

In addition, this channel type differs from others in that it is designed to provide a simple, combined API for channel creation, reuse and message sending. You can only create io.pnut.core.pm channels via the special endpoint for doing so.
